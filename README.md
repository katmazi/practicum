Data analyst student projects

During the course I was using data to create hypotheses, design experiments, and interpret results. Worked a lot with Python, SQL and Tableau Public;

As part of the course, I completed several projects:

| name | description | skills&tools |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------- |:--------------------|
| [AB_project.ipynb](https://github.com/katmazi/practicum-projects/blob/main/AB_project.ipynb "Practicum:") | In this project, I have studied the principles of event analytics. I built a sales funnel, researched the users' path to purchase. Analyzed the results of the A/B test for the introduction of new fonts. I compared 2 control groups with each other, made sure that the traffic was divided correctly, and then compared it with the test group. It was revealed that the new font will not significantly affect user behavior. | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, A/B testing, Product metrics, Statistical hypothesis testing |
| [clustering_project.ipynb](https://github.com/katmazi/practicum-projects/blob/main/clustering_project.ipynb "Practicum:")  | In this project, I used machine learning. With the help of which I predicted the probability of churn for each client. I formed typical portraits of users. I identified 5 groups, characterized their main properties and analyzed the main signs that most strongly affect the outflow. Based on the research, I gave recommendations to the fitness center. | Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Machine learning, classification, Clustering |
| [games_project.ipynb](https://github.com/katmazi/practicum-projects/blob/main/games_project.ipynb "Practicum:")| I have identified the parameters that determine the success of the game in different regions. Based on this, I gave recommendations to a computer game store for planning advertising campaigns. I've done data preprocessing, analysis. I chose the current period for analysis. I made portraits of users of each region. I tested hypotheses related to the difference in the ratings of games in different regions. In the analysis, I used the Student's criterion for independent samples. | Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Data preprocessing, Testing statistical hypotheses, Student's criteria |
| [telecom_project.ipynb](https://github.com/katmazi/practicum-projects/blob/main/telecom_project.ipynb "Practicum:")| Using the analysis of user behavior on the presented data sample, I recommended optimal sets of services for users. I've done data preprocessing, analysis. I tested hypotheses about the difference in revenue of subscribers of different tariffs and the difference in revenue of subscribers from Moscow and other regions. | Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Data preprocessing, Testing statistical hypotheses, Student's criteria |
